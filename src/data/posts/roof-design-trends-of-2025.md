Beware of Roofing Scams: How Shreveport Homeowners Can Find Trustworthy Contractors.

Has someone knocked on your door recently offering a “free roof inspection” after a storm? If you’re a homeowner in Shreveport, Bossier City, or anywhere within 60 miles of the area, you need to be able to distinguish between different types of roofing services available in our community.

## Making Informed Decisions About Your Roof

What Every Homeowner Should Know:

1. Temporary business arrangements might make warranty fulfillment challenging years later.
2. Varying levels of experience with local building codes and Northwest Louisiana weather conditions.
3. Different approaches to customer service and long-term relationship building.

> “In our 30 years of experience, we’ve seen that homeowners are most satisfied when they work with contractors who maintain clear communication throughout the project and remain accessible for follow-up service,” says Patt Henderson “Building strong relationships between homeowners and contractors benefits everyone in our community.”

## A Resource for Homeowners:

## How to Make an Informed Roofing Decision in Shreveport

What to Consider When Evaluating Roofing Proposals

1. Communication style - Do they explain options clearly without pressure?
2. Documentation - Are estimates, warranties and policies provided in writing?
3. Reference availability - Can they share examples of similar projects?
4. Insurance details - Is the contractor properly insured for your protection?
5. Payment structure - Are payment terms reasonable and clearly outlined?
6. Warranty information - Who will handle service if issues arise later?
