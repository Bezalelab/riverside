description: Spot the 5 signs your Shreveport roof needs replacing. Trust Riverside Roofing Materials for quality solutions and expert advice!
---
Your roof is your home’s first line of defense against Shreveport’s unpredictable weather. But how do you know when it’s time for a replacement? Ignoring warning signs can lead to costly repairs or damage to your home. At [Riverside Roofing Materials](https://riversideroofingmaterials.com/about), we’ve been supplying Shreveport contractors and homeowners with premium roofing products since 1994. In this blog, we’ll cover the top five signs it’s time to replace your roof and how we can help.

## Why Timely Roof Replacement Matters

A damaged or aging roof can lead to:

- **Leaks and water damage**, ruining interiors and fostering mold growth.
- **Higher energy bills** due to poor insulation.
- **Reduced curb appeal**, lowering your home’s value.
Replacing your roof at the right time protects your investment and keeps your home safe.

## 5 Signs Your Roof Needs Replacement

Here are the key indicators to watch for:

### 1. Missing or Damaged Shingles

- **What to look for**: Cracked, curled, or missing shingles, especially after storms.
- **Why it matters**: Damaged shingles expose your roof to water infiltration.
- **Riverside’s Solution**: We offer durable [Certainteed Shingles](https://riversideroofingmaterials.com/products/) and composite shingles designed for Shreveport’s high winds and rain.

### 2. Granule Loss

- **What to look for**: Granules in your gutters or bald spots on shingles.
- **Why it matters**: Granules protect shingles from UV rays; their loss shortens your roof’s lifespan.
- **Riverside’s Solution**: Our premium shingles, available in our [residential catalog](https://riversideroofingmaterials.com/products/), feature enhanced granule adhesion for longer durability.

### 3. Leaks or Water Stains

- **What to look for**: Water spots on ceilings or walls, or damp attic insulation.
- **Why it matters**: Leaks can cause structural damage and mold growth.
- **Riverside’s Solution**: We supply waterproof underlayments and flashing materials in our [product catalog](https://riversideroofingmaterials.com/products) to prevent leaks.

### 4. Aging Roof

- **What to look for**: Roofs over 20-25 years old (asphalt) or 40+ years (metal/tile) showing wear.
- **Why it matters**: Older roofs are less effective at protecting your home.
- **Riverside’s Solution**: Our experts, like Matt Stinson, can recommend modern materials from our [commercial](https://riversideroofingmaterials.com/products/#residential) and [residential catalogs](https://riversideroofingmaterials.com/products/#commercial) to upgrade your roof’s performance.

### 5. Sagging or Structural Issues
